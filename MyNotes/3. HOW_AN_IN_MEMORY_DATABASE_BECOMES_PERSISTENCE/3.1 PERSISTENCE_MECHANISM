1. You may ask: how can in-memory storage be persistent?.
2. The trick here is that you still keep everything in memory, but additionally you persist each operation on disk in a transaction log.
   Look at the picture (given in this folder (starts with 3.2)):
3. The first thing that you may notice is that even though your fast and nice in-memory database has got persistence now, queries don’t slow down.
4. Because they still hit only the main memory like they did with just an in-memory database.
5. But what about updates?
6. Each update (or let’s name it a transaction) should not only be applied to memory but also persisted on disk. 
7. A slow disk. Is it a problem?, Look at the picture (given in this folder (starts with 3.3));
8. Transactions are applied to the transaction log in an append-only way.
9. What is so good about that? When addressed in this append-only manner, disks are pretty fast.
