# I can explicitly set out expiry for a key for example

set a 4
expire a number_of_seconds

# In order to expire a key, a key must be created
# we can also perform creation and expiration set up of a key at once
# for example

setex key_name number_of_seconds value_of_key
[for example => setex b 10 anyvalue] - This will create a key named "b" having value "any value" and key "b" will expire after 10 seconds of creation

# we can also find out how much time is remaining for a key to get expired using "ttl" command
[for example => ttl key_name]
This will return the number of seconds remaining after which the key will get deleted or expired.
